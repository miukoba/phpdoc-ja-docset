    Client side global transaction ID injection exists as of mysqlnd_ms version 1.2.0-alpha.
    Transaction boundaries are detected by monitoring API calls. This is possible
    as of PHP 5.4.0. Please, see also <a href="mysqlnd-ms.transaction.html" class="link">Transaction handling</a>.
   </p>
   <p class="para">
    As of MySQL 5.6.5-m8 the MySQL server features built-in global transaction identifiers.
    The MySQL built-in global transaction ID feature is supported by PECL/mysqlnd_ms 1.3.0-alpha or
    later. Neither are client-side transaction boundary monitoring nor any setup
    activities required if using the server feature.
   </p>

  <p class="para">
   <em class="emphasis">Idea and client-side emulation</em>
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   PECL/mysqlnd_ms can do client-side transparent global transaction ID injection.
   In its most basic form, a global transaction identifier is a counter which is
   incremented for every transaction executed on the master. The counter is held
   in a table on the master. Slaves replicate the counter table.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   In case of a master failure a database administrator can easily identify the
   most recent slave for promiting it as a new master. The most recent slave has
   the highest transaction identifier.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   Application developers can ask the plugin for the global transaction identifier
   (GTID) for their last successful write operation. The plugin will return
   an identifier that refers to an transaction no older than that of the clients last
   write operation. Then, the GTID can be passed as a parameter
   to the quality of service (QoS) filter as an option for session consistency.
   Session consistency ensures read your writes. The filter ensures that all
   reads are either directed to a master or a slave which has replicated the write
   referenced by the GTID.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   <em class="emphasis">When injection is done</em>
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   The plugin transparently maintains the GTID table on the master.
   In autocommit mode the plugin injects an <em>UPDATE</em> statement
   before executing the users statement for every master use. In manual
   transaction mode, the injection is done before the application calls
   <em>commit()</em> to close a transaction. The configuration option
   <em>report_error</em> of the GTID section in the plugins configuration
   file is used to control whether a failed injection shall abort the current
   operation or be ignored silently (default).
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   Please note, the
   PHP version requirements for
   <a href="mysqlnd-ms.transaction.html" class="link">transaction boundary monitoring</a>
   and their limits.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   <em class="emphasis">Limitations</em>
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   Client-side global transaction ID injection has shortcomings. The potential
   issues are not specific to PECL/mysqlnd_ms but are rather of general nature.
   <ul class="itemizedlist">
    <li class="listitem">
     <span class="simpara">
      Global transaction ID tables must be deployed on all masters and replicas.
     </span>
    </li>
    <li class="listitem">
     <span class="simpara">
      The GTID can have holes. Only PHP clients using the plugin will
      maintain the table. Other clients will not.
     </span>
    </li>
    <li class="listitem">
     <span class="simpara">
      Client-side transaction boundary detection is based on API calls only.

    </li>
    <li class="listitem">
     <span class="simpara">
      Client-side transaction boundary detection does not take implicit
      commit into account. Some MySQL SQL statements cause an implicit

  <p class="para">
    <em class="emphasis">Using server-side global transaction identifier</em>
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   Starting with PECL/mysqlnd_ms 1.3.0-alpha the MySQL 5.6.5-m8 or newer built-in global
   transaction identifier feature is supported. Use of the server feature lifts
   all of the above listed limitations. Please, see the MySQL Reference Manual
   for limitations and preconditions for using server built-in global transaction
   identifiers.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   Whether to use the client-side emulation or the server built-in
   functionality is a question not directly related to the plugin, thus it is not
   discussed in depth. There are no plans to remove the client-side emulation and
   you can continue to use it, if the server-side solution is no option. This may
   be the case in heterogenous environments with old MySQL server or, if any of the
   server-side solution limitations is not acceptable.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   From an applications perspective there is hardly a difference in using one or the
   other approach. The following properties differ.
   <ul class="itemizedlist">
    <li class="listitem">
     <span class="simpara">
      Client-side emulation, as shown in the manual, is using an easy to compare sequence number
      for global transactions. Multi-master is not handled to keep the manual examples easy.
     </span>
     <span class="simpara">
      Server-side built-in feature is using a combination of a server identifier
      and a sequence number as a global transaction identifier. Comparison cannot
      use numeric algebra. Instead a SQL function must be used. Please,
      see the MySQL Reference Manual for details.
     </span>
    </li>
    <li class="listitem">
     <span class="simpara">
      Plugin global transaction ID statistics are only available with client-side
      emulation because they monitor the emulation.
     </span>
    </li>
   </ul>

  <blockquote class="note"><p><strong class="note">注意</strong>: 
   <strong>Global transaction identifiers in distributed systems</strong><br />
   <p class="para">
    Global transaction identifiers can serve multiple purposes in the context of distributed
    systems, such as a database cluster. Global transaction identifiers can
    be used for, for example, system wide identification of transactions,
    global ordering of transactions, heartbeat mechanism and
    for checking the replication status of replicas. PECL/mysqlnd_ms, a clientside
    driver based software, does focus on using GTIDs for tasks that can be
    handled at the client, such as checking the replication status of replicas
    for asynchronous replication setups.
