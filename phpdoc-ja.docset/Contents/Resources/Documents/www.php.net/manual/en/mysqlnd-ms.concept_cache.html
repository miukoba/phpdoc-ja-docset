  <blockquote class="note"><p><strong class="note">注意</strong>: 
   <strong>Suitable MySQL clusters</strong><br />
   <p class="para">
    The feature is targeted for use with MySQL Replication (primary copy).
    Currently, no other kinds of MySQL clusters are supported. Users
    of such cluster must control PECL/mysqlnd_qc manually if they are
    interested in client-side query caching.
   </p>
  </p></blockquote>
  <p class="para">
   Support for MySQL replication clusters (asynchronous primary copy) is the
   main focus of PECL/mysqlnd_ms. The slaves of a MySQL replication cluster
   may or may not reflect the latest updates from the master.
   Slaves are asynchronous and can lag behind the master. A read from a slave
   is eventual consistent from a cluster-wide perspective.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   The same level of consistency is offered by a local cache using time-to-live (TTL)
   invalidation strategy. Current data or stale data may be served. Eventually, data
   searched for in the cache is not available and the source of the cache needs to
   be accessed.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   Given that both a MySQL Replication slave (asynchronous secondary) and a local
   TTL-driven cache deliver the same level of service it is possible to transparently
   replace a remote database access with a local cache access to gain better possibility.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   As of PECL/mysqlnd_ms 1.3.0-beta the plugin is capable of transparently controlling
   PECL/mysqlnd_ms 1.1.0-alpha or newer to cache a read-only query if explicitly
   allowed by setting an appropriate quality of service through
    <span class="function"><a href="function.mysqlnd-ms-set-qos.html" class="function">mysqlnd_ms_set_qos()</a></span>. Please, see the
   <a href="mysqlnd-ms.quickstart.cache.html" class="link">quickstart</a> for a code example.
   Both plugins must be installed, PECL/mysqlnd_ms must be compiled to support the
   cache feature and PHP 5.4.0 or newer has to be used.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   Applications have full control of cache usage and can request fresh data
   at any time, if need be. Thec ache usage can be enabled and disabled
   time during the execution of a script. The cache will be used
   if  <span class="function"><a href="function.mysqlnd-ms-set-qos.html" class="function">mysqlnd_ms_set_qos()</a></span> sets the quality of service
   to eventual consistency and enables cache usage. Cache usage is disabled by
   requesting higher consistency levels, for example,
   session consistency (read your writes). Once the quality of service has been
   relaxed to eventual consistency the cache can be used again.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   If caching is enabled for a read-only statement, PECL/mysqlnd_ms may inject
   <a href="mysqlnd-qc.quickstart.caching.html" class="link">SQL hints to control caching</a>
   by PECL/mysqlnd_qc. It may modify the SQL statement it got from the application.
   Subsequent SQL processors are supposed to ignore the SQL hints. A SQL hint is a
   SQL comment. Comments must not be ignored, for example, by the database server.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   The TTL of a cache entry is computed on a per statement basis. Applications
   set an maximum age for the data they want to retrieve using
    <span class="function"><a href="function.mysqlnd-ms-set-qos.html" class="function">mysqlnd_ms_set_qos()</a></span>. The age sets an approximate upper limit
   of how many seconds the data returned may lag behind the master.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   The following logic is used to compute the actual TTL if caching is enabled.
   The logic takes the estimated slave lag into account for choosing a TTL. If,
   for example, there are two slaves lagging 5 and 10 seconds behind and the maximum
   age allowed is 60 seconds, the TTL is set to 50 seconds. Please note, the
   age setting is no more than an estimated guess.

      Send <em>SHOW SLAVE STATUS</em> to all slaves. Do not wait

      If both conditions hold true, fetch the value of <em>Seconds_Behind_Master</em>.
      In case of any errors or if conditions fail, set an error on the slave connection.
      Skip any such slave connection for the rest of connection filtering.

      The filtering may sort out all slaves. If so, the maximum age is used as
      TTL, because the maximum lag found equals zero. It is perfectly valid to
      sort out all slaves. In the following it is up to subsequent filter
      to decide what to do. The built-in load balancing filter will pick the

      PECL/mysqlnd_qc is loaded after PECL/mysqlnd_ms by PHP. Thus, it will see

     </span>
    </li>
   </ul>
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   The algorithm may seem expensive. <em>SHOW SLAVE STATUS</em> is a very
   fast operation. Given a sufficient number of requests and cache hits per second the cost of
   checking the slaves lag can easily outweight the costs of the cache decision.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   Suggestions on a better algorithm are always welcome.
