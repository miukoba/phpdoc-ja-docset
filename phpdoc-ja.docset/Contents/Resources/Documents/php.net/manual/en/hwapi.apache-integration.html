 <h1>Integration with Apache</h1>

 <p class="para">
  The Hyperwave extension is best used when PHP is compiled as an
  Apache module. In such a case the underlying Hyperwave server can
  be hidden from users almost completely if Apache uses its rewriting
  engine. The following instructions will explain this.
 </p>
 <p class="para">
  Since PHP with Hyperwave support built into Apache is intended
  to replace the native Hyperwave solution based on Wavemaster, we
  will assume that the Apache server will only serve as a Hyperwave
  web interface for these examples. This is not necessary but it simplifies
  the configuration. The concept is quite simple. First of all you
  need a PHP script which evaluates the <var class="varname"><var class="varname"><a href="reserved.variables.environment.html" class="classname">$_ENV['PATH_INFO']</a></var></var>
  variable and treats its value as the name of a Hyperwave
  object. Let&#039;s call this script <em>&#039;Hyperwave&#039;</em>. The URL
  <em>http://your.hostname/Hyperwave/name_of_object</em>
  would than return the Hyperwave object with the name
  <em>&#039;name_of_object&#039;</em>. Depending on the type of the object
  the script has to react accordingly. If it is a collection, it will probably
  return a list of children. If it is a document it will return the
  mime type and the content. A slight improvement can be achieved
  if the Apache rewriting engine is used. From the users point of
  view it would be more straight forward if the URL
  <em>http://your.hostname/name_of_object</em> would
  return the object. The rewriting rule is quite easy:

  <div class="informalexample">
   <div class="example-contents">
<div class="apache-confcode"><pre class="apache-confcode">RewriteRule ^/(.*) /usr/local/apache/htdocs/HyperWave/$1 [L]</pre>
</div>
   </div>

  </div>

  Now every URL relates to an object in the Hyperwave server. This
  causes a simple to solve problem. There is no way to execute a
  different script, e.g. for searching, than the &#039;Hyperwave&#039;
  script. This can be fixed with another rewriting rule like the
  following:

  <div class="informalexample">
   <div class="example-contents">
<div class="apache-confcode"><pre class="apache-confcode">RewriteRule ^/hw/(.*) /usr/local/apache/htdocs/hw/$1 [L]</pre>
</div>
   </div>

  </div>

  This will reserve the directory <var class="filename">/usr/local/apache/htdocs/hw</var>
  for additional scripts and other files. Just make sure this rule is
  evaluated before the one above. There is just a little drawback:
  all Hyperwave objects whose name starts with <em>&#039;hw/&#039;</em>
  will be shadowed. So, make sure you don&#039;t use such names. If you need
  more directories, e.g. for images just add more rules or place
  them all in one directory. Before you put those instructions, don&#039;t
  forget to turn on the rewriting engine with

  <div class="informalexample">
   <div class="example-contents">
<div class="apache-confcode"><pre class="apache-confcode">RewriteEngine on</pre>
</div>
   </div>

  </div>

  You will need scripts:

  <ul class="itemizedlist">
    <li class="listitem">
     <span class="simpara">
     to return the object itself
     </span>
    </li>
    <li class="listitem">
     <span class="simpara">
     to allow searching
     </span>
    </li>
    <li class="listitem">
     <span class="simpara">
     to identify yourself
     </span>
    </li>
    <li class="listitem">
     <span class="simpara">
     to set your profile
     </span>
    </li>
    <li class="listitem">
     <span class="simpara">
     one for each additional function like to show
     the object attributes, to show information about users,
     to show the status of the server, etc.
     </span>
    </li>
  </ul>
 </p>
 <p class="para">
  As an alternative to the Rewrite Engine, you can also consider using
  the Apache <em>ErrorDocument</em> directive, but be aware,
  that <em>ErrorDocument</em> redirected pages cannot receive
  POST data.
