  <div class="sect2" id="history.phpfi">
   <h3 class="title">PHP Tools, FI, Construction Kit, and PHP/FI</h3>
   <p class="para">
    PHP as it's known today is actually the successor to a
    product named PHP/FI. Created in 1994 by Rasmus Lerdorf,
    the very first incarnation of PHP was a simple set of
    Common Gateway Interface (CGI) binaries written in the C
    programming language. Originally used for tracking visits
    to his online resume, he named the suite of scripts "Personal
    Home Page Tools," more frequently referenced as "PHP Tools."
    Over time, more functionality was desired, and Rasmus rewrote
    PHP Tools, producing a much larger and richer implementation.
    This new model was capable of database interaction and more,
    providing a framework upon which users could develop simple dynamic
    web applications such as guestbooks. In June of 1995, Rasmus
    <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.infosystems.www.authoring.cgi/msg/cc7d43454d64d133" class="link external">»&nbsp;released</a>
    the source code for PHP Tools to the public, which allowed
    developers to use it as they saw fit. This also permitted -
    and encouraged - users to provide fixes for bugs in the code,
    and to generally improve upon it.
   </p>
   <p class="para">
    In September of that year, Rasmus expanded upon PHP and - for a
    short time - actually dropped the PHP name.  Now referring to the
    tools as FI (short for "Forms Interpreter"), the new implementation
    included some of the basic functionality of PHP as we know
    it today. It had Perl-like variables, automatic interpretation
    of form variables, and HTML embedded syntax. The syntax itself
    was similar to that of Perl, albeit much more limited, simple,
    and somewhat inconsistent.  In fact, to embed the code into an
    HTML file, developers had to use HTML comments.  Though this
    method was not entirely well-received, FI continued to enjoy growth
    and acceptance as a CGI tool --- but still not quite as a language.
    However, this began to change the following month; in October, 1995,
    Rasmus released a complete rewrite of the code.  Bringing back the
    PHP name, it was now (briefly) named "Personal Home Page Construction
    Kit," and was the first release to boast what was, at the time,
    considered an advanced scripting interface. The language was
    deliberately designed to resemble C in structure, making it an easy
    adoption for developers familiar with C, Perl, and similar languages.
    Having been thus far limited to UNIX and POSIX-compliant systems,
    the potential for a Windows NT implementation was being explored.
   </p>
   <p class="para">
    The code got another complete makeover, and in April of 1996,
    combining the names of past releases, Rasmus introduced PHP/FI.
    This second-generation implementation began to truly evolve PHP
    from a suite of tools into a programming language in its own
    right.  It included built-in support for DBM, mSQL, and Postgres95
    databases, cookies, user-defined function support, and much more.
    That June, PHP/FI was given a version 2.0 status.  An interesting
    fact about this, however, is that there was only one single full
    version of PHP 2.0.  When it finally graduated from beta status
    in November, 1997, the underlying parsing engine was already
    being entirely rewritten.
   </p>
   <p class="para">
    Though it lived a short development life, it continued to enjoy
    a growing popularity in still-young world of web development. In
    1997 and 1998, PHP/FI had a cult of several thousand users around
    the world.  A Netcraft survey as of May, 1998, indicated that
    nearly 60,000 domains reported having headers containing
    "PHP", indicating that the host server did indeed have it installed.
    This number equated to approximately 1% of all domains on the
    Internet at the time. Despite these impressive figures, the maturation
    of PHP/FI was doomed to limitations; while there were several minor
    contributors, it was still primarily developed by an individual.

   <h3 class="title">PHP 3</h3>
   <p class="para">
    PHP 3.0 was the first version that closely resembles PHP as
    it exists today. Finding PHP/FI 2.0 still inefficient and
    lacking features they needed to power an eCommerce application
    they were developing for a university project, Andi Gutmans and
    Zeev Suraski of Tel Aviv, Israel, began yet another complete
    rewrite of the underlying parser in 1997.  Approaching Rasmus
    online, they discussed various aspects of the current
    implementation and their redevelopment of PHP.  In an effort to
    improve the engine and start building upon PHP/FI's existing
    user base, Andi, Rasmus, and Zeev decided to collaborate in
    the development of a new, independent programming language.
    This entirely new language was released under a new name, that
    removed the implication of limited personal use that the
    PHP/FI 2.0 name held. It was renamed simply 'PHP', with the
    meaning becoming a recursive acronym - PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.
   </p>
   <p class="para">
    One of the biggest strengths of PHP 3.0 was its strong
    extensibility features. In addition to providing end users
    with a mature interface for multiple databases, protocols,
    and APIs, the ease of extending the language itself attracted
    dozens of developers who submitted a variety of modules. Arguably,
    this was the key to PHP 3.0's tremendous success. Other key
    features introduced in PHP 3.0 included object-oriented programming
    support and a far more powerful and consistent language syntax.
   </p>
   <p class="para">
    In June, 1998, with many new developers from around the world
    joining the effort, PHP 3.0 was announced by the new PHP Development
    Team as the official successor to PHP/FI 2.0.  Active development
    of PHP/FI 2.0, which had all-but ceased as of November of the
    previous year, was now officially ended.  After roughly nine months
    of open public testing, when the announcement of the official
    release of PHP 3.0 came, it was already installed on over 70,000
    domains around the world, and was no longer limited to
    POSIX-compliant operating systems.  A relatively small share of
    the domains reporting PHP as installed were hosted on servers
    running Windows 95, 98, and NT, and Macintosh.  At its peak, PHP 3.0
    was installed on approximately 10% of the web servers on the
    Internet.
   </p>
  </div>

  <div class="sect2" id="history.php4">
   <h3 class="title">PHP 4</h3>
   <p class="para">
    By the winter of 1998, shortly after PHP 3.0 was officially
    released, Andi Gutmans and Zeev Suraski had begun working
    on a rewrite of PHP's core. The design goals were to improve
    performance of complex applications, and improve the
    modularity of PHP's code base. Such applications were made
    possible by PHP 3.0's new features and support for a wide
    variety of third party databases and APIs, but PHP 3.0 was
    not designed to handle such complex applications efficiently.
   </p>
   <p class="para">
    The new engine, dubbed 'Zend Engine' (comprised of their
    first names, Zeev and Andi), met these design goals
    successfully, and was first introduced in mid 1999. PHP 4.0,
    based on this engine, and coupled with a wide range of
    additional new features, was officially released in May
    2000, almost two years after its predecessor.  In addition
    to the highly improved performance of this version, PHP 4.0
    included other key features such as support for many more
    web servers, HTTP sessions, output buffering, more secure
    ways of handling user input and several new language constructs.
   </p>
  </div>

  <div class="sect2" id="history.php5">
   <h3 class="title">PHP 5</h3>
   <p class="para">
    PHP 5 was released in July 2004 after long development and several
    pre-releases. It is mainly driven by its core, the
    <em>Zend Engine 2.0</em> with a
    new object model and dozens of other new features.
   </p>
   <p class="para">
    PHP's development team includes dozens of developers, as well
    as dozens others working on PHP-related and supporting projects,
    such as PEAR, PECL, and documentation, and an underlying network
    infrastructure of well over one-hundred individual web servers
    on six of the seven continents of the world.  Though only an
    estimate based upon statistics from previous years, it is safe
    to presume PHP is now installed on tens or even perhaps hundreds
    of millions of domains around the world.
