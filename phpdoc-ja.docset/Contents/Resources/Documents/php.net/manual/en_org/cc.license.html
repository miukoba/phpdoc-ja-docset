    other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by
    reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual
    creations, in which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along with
    one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in

 <ol type="a">
  <li class="listitem">
   <span class="simpara">
    You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License.
    You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License
    with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or
    impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of
    the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the
    terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all
    notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy
    of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly
    Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work
    that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights
    granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to
    the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection
    apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You
    create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
    practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as
    requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the
    extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(b),
    as requested.

  <li class="listitem">

    If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You
    must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all
    copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are
    utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if
    supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or
    parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution
    ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other
    reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if
    supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor
    specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the
    copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with
    Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work
    in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or
    "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this
    Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in
    the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a
    credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as
    part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the
    other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit
    required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above
    and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or
    explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the
    Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your
    use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the

    modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be
    prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in
    those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in
    Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a
    distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the
    Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as

    The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were
    drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of
    Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of
    1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty
    of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These
    rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the
    License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of
    the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the
    standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional
    rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be
    included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any
    rights under applicable law.
